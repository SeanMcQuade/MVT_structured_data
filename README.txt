In this folder you will find the script to generate the slimmed v2.1 of MVT I-24MOTION data used in the Nature paper submission
along with the energy models and road grad mapping for the testbed. 

save_i24motiondata_v2_point_1_slim.m : 		script to generate the data from the slim v2.0 data generated by the I-24 MOTION team.
fuel_model_{vehicle_type}_simplified.m:  	simplified instentanous energy devloped by CIRCLES energy team.
Eastbound_grade_fit.csv:			mapping of road grade and elevation for the MVT testbed.

The resulting I-24MOTION data files will be saved in \Results sub folder. split into continuous chunks of traffic data in .json files.
{source}_slim_{date}_{start time}.json is the naming convention of the data. The date in YYYY-MM-DD format and the start time is in houres-minutes-seconds (Central Time) 
for files that represent a chunk of the source data for that day, and empty if all source data is in one file.

-- Do not share this data outside of CIRCLES --
